Excited to share my latest project where I deep-dived into the 
Maven Movies rental dataset using Power BI! ğŸš€

This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of rental trends, customer behavior, and category performance:
ğŸ”¹ Revenue Trends â€“ Visualized monthly revenue across 2005â€“2006, highlighting spikes and dips.
 ğŸ”¹ Top Customers â€“ Identified the highest spenders based on rental amounts.
 ğŸ”¹ Category Insights â€“ Analyzed rentals by genre, rental rate distribution, and average rental duration (ğŸ“Œ Travel tops the list with the highest average duration!).
 ğŸ”¹ Geographical Analysis â€“ Mapped rental activity by country to understand regional engagement.
 ğŸ”¹ Customer & Staff Metrics â€“ Tracked the number of unique customers and staff performance per month.
 
This project has helped sharpen my data storytelling skills and bring out actionable insights through visual analytics.
