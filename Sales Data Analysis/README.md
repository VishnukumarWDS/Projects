🚀 Power BI Sales Dashboard Project
I recently developed an interactive Sales Dashboard using Power BI to analyze real-world sales data and uncover valuable business insights. This project allowed me to apply key data analytics techniques and strengthen my Power BI skills, from data modeling to visualization.

🔍 Key Highlights:
📊 Dashboard Features: Yearly sales trends, regional performance comparisons, top-selling product categories, and key KPIs.
🧹 Data Cleaning: Used Power Query to clean raw data by removing duplicates, handling null values, and standardizing formats.
🔢 DAX Measures: Created custom measures for dynamic KPIs like Total Sales, Profit Margin, Year-over-Year Growth, and Top Region by Revenue.
🌍 Data Modeling: Optimized relationships using a star schema for faster performance and better data structuring.
📌 Challenges: Faced issues with inconsistent region names and missing data; resolved using normalization techniques and lookup tables.
🧠 Outcome: Built a professional, responsive dashboard that enables users to quickly explore business metrics and identify sales opportunities.
